    "description": "An image is an artifact that depicts visual perception, for example, a photo or a two-dimensional picture, that has a similar appearance to some subjectâ€”usually a physical object or a person, thus providing a depiction of it. Above is the unprocessed rendering of your image.",

    "description": "A grayscale image is one in which the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light, that is, it carries only intensity information. Above is a desaturated image, showing only light intensity. This is accomplished by averaging each pixel rgb values together. Above is a grayscale representation of your image.",

    "description": "In photography, a negative is an image, usually on a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film, in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. Above is a negative image, showing each pixels opposite. This is accomplished by finding the compliment of each 8 bit rgb value. Above is the compliment of your image.",

  "Zoom" : {
    "title": "Zoom Image",
    "description": "Image scaling can be interpreted as a form of image resampling or image reconstruction from the view of the Nyquist sampling theorem. According to the theorem, downsampling to a smaller image from a higher-resolution original can only be carried out only after applying a suitable 2D anti-aliasing filter to prevent aliasing artifacts. The image is reduced to the information that can be carried by the smaller image. Above is an image zoomed 2x using interpolation of the nearest neighbor. Above is your image zoomed.",
