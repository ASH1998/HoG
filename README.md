# HoG
Define a signature by Histogram of Gradients and visualize. Use scikit-learn svmclassifier to predict sample space. 

**Usage**
Choose file/photo, best results 1200x700 (webcam picture), Drag sample space to desired location. Click train/test button. A visualization of the HoG will be overlayed on sample space along with a graphing of each bin. The server will respond with the predicted classification of object. If the prediction is correct click "yes" otherwise click "no" and properly classify the sample space object. Note, program only works from desktop.
